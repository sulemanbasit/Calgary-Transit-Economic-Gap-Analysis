The project is inspired by "UrbanAlliance - ECON Capstone Idea - PTN Gap Analysis" pdf.

Problem Statement: 
This project will assess the planned investments in the Primary Transit Network against socio-economic variables to determine if there are gaps or adjustments necessary. Students may consider variables such as socio-economic profiles of individuals/households or other equity seeking groups which may rely disproportionately on transit for their mobility (lower-income households, new/recent immigrants, service sector employment, affordable housing).

Report:
For the project, we assessed through the typical economic method: Demand of the Calgarians and the current and future Supply of Calgary's Primary Transit Network (consisting of Max buses and transit line). Based on the literature we found on the topic, the demand index was calculated based on 4 factors/groups:
Seniors: The demographic of people that are from 65 years old and over.
Low Income: The demographic of people or household that make <= $26,503.
Household Income on Rent: The demographic of people who spend more than 30% of their income on rent.
Transit for Work: The demographic of employees who are using transit to commute to work.
