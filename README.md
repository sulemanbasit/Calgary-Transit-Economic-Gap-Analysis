Problem Statement: 
This project will assess the planned investments in the Primary Transit Network against socio-economic variables to determine if there are gaps or adjustments necessary. Students may consider variables such as socio-economic profiles of individuals/households or other equity seeking groups which may rely disproportionately on transit for their mobility (lower-income households, new/recent immigrants, service sector employment, affordable housing).
